# Handler Refactors

Welcome.

This repository contains a whole bunch of mini-websites for you to study and practice refactoring.  Each one implements a single user story, and each one is organized in a similar way. The goal of these exercises isn't to create mind-blowing projects.

Instead the goal to get lots of practice navigating source code, debugging, and refactoring logic from handlers.  (hint: don't modify the `challenge.html` files, you will want them for reference.  Copy them into `solution.html` and write your solution there)
